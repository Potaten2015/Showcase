# My 3D Showcase

A virtual room displaying my development experience, and showing some creative possibilities for displaying information.

Technologies:
Flask + PostgreSQL backend API -> User authentication and long-term data storage <br />
Nodejs + Reach + Redux frontend -> state management and modular components <br />
React-three-fiber -> ThreeJS and React integration <br />
Google Places API -> Visitor geographic information <br />

### Points of Interest
1. Custom signup/signin and comment form fields, with 3D text wrapping and manipulation. Uses hidden forms to manage form submission without interrupting the UI/UX flow. Also allows for user selection of comment color.
2. Infinitely scrolling comment board with live update on comment post.
3. 3D elevation map of the world works with Google Places API to grab user location and scale Lat and Long info to a specific location on the map.
4. Live links to project websites and professional profiles, with button hover effects. 
5. Ability to navigate the environment using custom scripts for WASD and mouse movements.
